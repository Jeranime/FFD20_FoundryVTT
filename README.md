# FFD20_FoundryVTT
A project which intends to import everything from Final Fantasy D20 into Pathfinder 1e.

The project is at its very early stages, with myself coming to gripes with how to implement classes and such into the program. I am aware that there is a project which has completed some of this already. However, I intend to start from scratch to understand the structure of this module as well as the Foundry system.

## Project Version 0.0.1
